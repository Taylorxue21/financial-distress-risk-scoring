An XGBoost-powered, fully explainable financial risk analysis system for US public companies. It integrates multi-dimensional market data, fundamental financial statements, and macroeconomic indicators into a buy-side grade Streamlit dashboard. 

**Target**: Predict if a company will severely underperform the S&P 500 (`Alpha < -30%`) over the next 12 months, and explain *why* using SHAP local attribution.

## ✨ Core Features

- **🚨 Top-Down Risk Leaderboard**: Instantly screens the market universe to flag companies with the highest probability of severe drawdown, complete with auto-generated risk drivers.
- **🌌 Multi-Dimensional Risk Landscape**: Dynamic parallel coordinates to map out structural risks across sectors. Visually identify financial anomalies in high-leverage or low-cash environments.
- **🕸️ Sector Peer Radar**: A smart-theme adapted polar chart that benchmarks a specific company against its GICS sector median baseline in real-time.
- **📉 Explainable AI (XAI) Attribution**: A highly customized, presentation-ready SHAP waterfall chart. It breaks down the "black-box" XGBoost prediction into granular financial impacts (Log-Odds), providing absolute transparency.
- **☁️ Zero-Cost Deployment**: Designed to run entirely on free-tier services (e.g., local PostgreSQL + Streamlit) for automated, cost-free monitoring.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local Deployment)

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=postgres
```

### 2. Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/Taylorxue21/SP500-Equities-Financial-Risk-Scorer.git
cd us-public-company-financial-risk-scoring
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 3. Run the Dashboard
Launch the interactive Streamlit application:

Bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_sector_peer_app.py
☁️ Zero-Cost Automated Deployment (Recommended)
To run this dashboard 24/7 without local computing costs, you can deploy it directly to Streamlit Community Cloud:

Push this repository to your GitHub.

Sign in to Streamlit Share.

Click New app, select this repository, and set the main file path to app/streamlit_sector_peer_app.py.

Add your database secrets in the Streamlit Advanced Settings.

Click Deploy to get your public dashboard URL instantly.

## 🧠 Modeling Approach

### 1. Robust Time-Based Evaluation Schema
To strictly prevent look-ahead bias and data leakage, the dataset is split using a chronological spine. The model is trained on pre-2020 data, tuned on 2021-2022 macroeconomic shocks, and evaluated blindly on the 2023-2024 high-interest-rate regime.

### 2. Tail-Risk Decision Boundary Optimization
Traditional classifiers default to a `0.5` probability threshold, which is commercially fatal for tail-risk management. As visualized in our **Precision-Recall Curve** below, the asset's downside risk is highly non-linear. By maximizing the F1-Score on the validation surface, the system discovers an optimal risk trigger at **`0.0839`**.

| Precision-Recall Curve (AUC = 0.959) | Optimized Wind-Tunnel Confusion Matrix |
| :---: | :---: |

* **Downside Protection (Recall = 97.03%)**: At the `0.0839` systemic threshold, the model successfully captures and intercepts 97% of the absolute drawdowns (`Alpha <= -30%`) in the blind test set.
* **Signal Reliability (Precision = 85.45%)**: Despite the aggressive protective posture, the signal maintains an 85.4% accuracy rate, significantly minimizing false alarms and preserving portfolio opportunity costs.

### 3. Zero-Latency Inference Architecture
Engineered a decoupled production pipeline. By implementing `@st.cache_resource` for offline model loading, the system bypasses real-time training overhead, delivering instant buy-side risk scoring capabilities without latency.

### 4. Explainability (XAI)
Utilizes `shap.TreeExplainer` to decompose every prediction into readable financial metrics, breaking the traditional machine learning black-box and aligning with institutional compliance standards.
